## ðŸ§© State Management with Zustand

This project uses Zustand for state management, which offers several advantages:

- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- No reducers, actions, or dispatchers
- Easy integration with React hooks
- Built-in state persistence capabilities
- Excellent TypeScript support

The store setup is simple and intuitive:

```javascript
// src/store/index.js
import create from "zustand";

export const useStore = create((set, get) => ({
  items: [],
  addItem: (text) => {
    /* implementation */
  },
  removeItem: (id) => {
    /* implementation */
  },
  toggleItem: (id) => {
    /* implementation */
  },
}));
```
